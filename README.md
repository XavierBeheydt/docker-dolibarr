# 🐳 Docker - Dolibarr

This repository helps to backup my services settings and how to use them. The service here is Dolibarr
and it's my ERP CRM for my dev job.

## 🛠️ How to run

**Makefile**

Here, I'm using docker compose for manage services and for simplify the commands
I use a [Makefile](./Makefile).

About docker commands check the following commands :

```bash
# Build and start
make up

# Others
make stop
make start
make restart
```
